title: Three things I learned from The Ruby Koans
---

Here are (at least) three things I learned from [The Ruby Koans](http://rubykoans.com/):

 1. You are able to interact with .txt files, including reading the number of lines.

 2. Strings are unique objects.

 3. false and nil are treated as false but everything else is treated as true.
